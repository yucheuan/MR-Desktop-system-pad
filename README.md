### Intro
“Embodied virtuality is the process of drawing computers out of their electronic shells,” said Mark Wieser in 1993, demonstrating a vision of ubiquitous computing that weaves into the fabric of everyday life. However, the pervasive factor of human-computer interaction is lacking in discussions.

Our everyday life is established by daily objects and locative media. The object-oriented relationship is prevailing and defines how humans require and collect knowledge from affordance and navigate in a given environment. Hence, the project, Mixed-Reality Desktop (MR-Desktop), aims to speculate the contemporary domestic space attributes when immersed in a context of pervasive virtuality, using mixed-reality technology. 

MR-Desktop is a portable and contextualized system supporting multi-task reconfiguration on a common desktop setup within a limited domestic space, envisioning the future haptic human-computer interaction of the MR-Desktop system and phygital objects. Such MR-Desktop updates the human-computer modality based on perceived affordance and architectural ergonomics, resulting in an intuitive, effective, and shareable lifestyle.

(The project development includes user research, lo-fi rendering, mockup animation, and unity prototyping.)
